# Mirabella Font Installation

To complete the font implementation:

1. Purchase or download the Mirabella luxury branding font
2. Place the following font files in this directory:
   - Mirabella.woff2
   - Mirabella.woff
   - Mirabella.ttf

The website is already configured to use these files once they are placed here.

## Fallback

Until you add the actual Mirabella font files, the website will fall back to using serif fonts.

## Font Sources

Mirabella can typically be purchased from premium font marketplaces like:
- MyFonts
- Adobe Fonts
- Creative Market
- Font Squirrel

1. Place the following Cowra font files in this directory:

## Fallback

Until you add the actual Cowra font files, the website will fall back to using serif fonts.
